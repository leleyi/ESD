# Lab4
## OBJECTIVES
● Students can install FreeRTOS
● Students study the customization of FreeRTOS
● Students understand the structure of the FreeRTOS
● Students can write simple program with multiple tasks, queue, semaphores and mutexes

## OVERVIEW
   Laboratory work 4 is aimed at obtaining initial knowledge and skills of using semaphores and mutexes for process synchronization in FreeRTOS.

## Task
   1. Read the FreeRTOS documentation about semaphores and mutexes
2. Create a new project
3. Do the task according your variant. The variant can be calculated using the last digit of your ID. For example, if your ID is 192050183 your variant will be 3. If your ID is 192050180 your variant will be 10.
4. Write a report (1 point).
5. Put the entire project (src) in GitHub, use .gitignore if it necessary (1 point)
6. Read the FreeRTOS documentation and answer on the questions (2 points per question) in Yandex Forms https://forms.yandex.ru/u/5f0ac19632e5cb343c54e59d/
